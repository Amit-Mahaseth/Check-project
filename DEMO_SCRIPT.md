## 0:00 - Introduction
"Namaste Judges! Developing software is hard. Keeping up with documentation, code reviews, and new tech is even harder. Meet **CodeSherpa** - The AI companion built for the 5 million+ developers in India."

## 0:30 - The Problem & Solution
"Junior devs often struggle to understand complex codebases, and seniors are overwhelmed with PR reviews. CodeSherpa solves this with specialized AI Agents."

## 1:00 - DEMO: Review Monk (The Code Reviewer)
*(Show Dashboard)*
"Let's look at **Review Monk**. It connects directly to GitHub."
*(Action: Trigger 'Review demo' or show the hardcoded review)*
"See how it catches a **Critical Security Issue** (hardcoded secret) and even suggests an IST timezone fix? That's context awareness."

## 1:45 - DEMO: CodeSherpa (The Teacher)
"Now, for learning. Many devs learn better in their native language."
*(Action: Type 'Namaste demo' in Chat)*
"Here, the agent explains React Hooks using a 'Bijli/Switch' analogy in Hinglish. It breaks down barriers to entry."

## 2:30 - Architecture & Integrations
"We built this on **AWS Bedrock using Claude 3.5 Sonnet** for high reasoning capabilities. We use **LangGraph** for orchestration and have a **WhatsApp** integration for mobile access."

## 2:50 - Closing
